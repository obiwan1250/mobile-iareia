			<h2><center>OUR MISSION </center></h2>
			<h3><em><em><strong>To be the essential resource for improving member performance and creating a business environment favorable to residential rental property owners, managers, real estate entrepreneurs, and our industry stakeholders.</strong></em></em></h3>
		  <h3>ABOUT OUR MEMBERSHIP AND MEMBERSHIP BENEFITS</h3>
			  <p><strong>WHO WE ARE:</strong> After 32 years as the Iowa Landlord Association (ILA), and 6 years as Two Rivers REIA of Central Iowa (TRREIA), <em>we are merging three elements of these two organizations</em> — <strong>E</strong>ducation, <strong>L</strong>egislation, and <strong>M</strong>arketing (ELM).   Both organizations now form a Chapter of the National REIA (<a title="NaREIA" href="http://www.nationalreia.com/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">NaREIA</a>) and we are forming an alliance with the <strong>A</strong>merican <strong>R</strong>ental<strong>P</strong>roperty <strong>O</strong>wners and <strong>L</strong>andlords <strong>A</strong>ssociation (<a title="ARPOLA" href="http://www.arpola.org/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">ARPOLA</a>).   We intend to  expand and enhance both of these relationships — to increase value for our members.
		  
			
			  </p>
			  <h2>The ELM parts of ILA and TRREIA are now addressed by IaREIA – The Iowa Real Estate Investors Association.    </h2>
			  <p><strong>OUR NATIONAL AFFILIATIONS</strong>:  National REIA, with over 40,000 members, 200+ affiliate groups, and 30+ Chapters across the US,  provides outstanding education and networking opportunities for our Iowa-based members.  ARPOLA is an emerging, affordable option for our multi-family owners and managers who can benefit from association with a National Landlord group.    Both national groups provide educational opportunities, association leadership training, Tier-1 Vendor offerings, national lobbying, and services that simply would not be available were we not a member.
		  
			
		      </p>
			  <p><strong>WHO WE SERVE:</strong> We serve owners and property managers of <em><strong>residential rental property</strong></em>across Iowa, from the Missouri to the Mississippi – through the Iowa Landlord Association — and we serve real estate entrepreneurs, from the Missouri to the Mississippi – through Two Rivers REIA of Central Iowa.   In those areas where we do not currently offer district meetings, we offer membership in IaREIA.
		  
			
		      </p>
			  <p><strong>OUR MEMBERS and MEMBERSHIPS:</strong>  Our members include affiliated industry stakeholders — those who are in the Residential Rental and Investment Property Industries, and those who serve those industries.  Some members join the ILA, others join TRREIA, and still others join IaREIA — which is our &ldquo;At Large&rdquo; membership for those who live more than 60 miles from a local, district meeting.   You&rsquo;ll find more details under membership type.
		  
			
		      </p>
			  <p><strong>SCOPE OF SERVICE:</strong>  Our associations are extending our outreach across Iowa primarily to enhance our effectiveness at the State General Assembly level.   We have a 50-Senate District and 100-House District strategy to accomplish our objectives, so we serve members across the entire state.    Because many rental property owners are looking for new and creative ways to expand their real estate investment portfolio (best accomplished by being a member of ILA) and to create income generating opportunities (best accomplished by being a member of TRREIA), and both groups benefit from fair and balanced legislation at the State Level, <strong><em>we are stretching out our tent stakes from &ldquo;River to River&rdquo;.    No other organization in the state offers this mix of opportunity for networking.  </em></strong>
		  
			
		      </p>
			  <p><strong>STATEWIDE LOBBYING:</strong> Through the Iowa Rental Property Owners Political Action Committee (<a title="Iowa Rental Property Owners Political Action Committee " href="http://iareia.com/ia-rpo-pac/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">IARPOPAC</a>) and our lobbying activities, we assist in the creation and modification of State Laws for a fair and balanced approach to our business enterprises.
		  
			
		      </p>
			  <p><strong>LOCAL LOBBYING THROUGH DISTRICT GROUPS</strong>: Through &ldquo;District Sub-Groups&rdquo;, that can operate like a franchise, we help local leaders to be freed up to focus on their local issues.   Instead of being burdened with administrative headaches, which will accrue to any organization over time, we enable our District leaders to focus on what really matters — helping their groups deal with local ordinances and education for members to help members become, or remain, successful.   We feel this is a more effective business model, reducing tensions between &ldquo;competing&rdquo; chapters.  We strive to create a &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all in this together&rdquo; attitude.   The &ldquo;every Landlord for himself&rdquo; perspective has seemingly yielded very poor results at the State level, and in many municipalities, for decades.  Part of our mission is to reverse this trend, to start to provide win-win outcomes for our members — rather than the &ldquo;Municipalities can win only when Real Estate Investors lose&rdquo; mentality.
		  
			
		      </p>
			  <p><strong>ASSISTANCE TO OUR DISTRICTS</strong>:  The daily grind for administrative responsibilities can be overwhelming.    We serve to assist, not to control.  Though there are many administrative functions which  are handled better with centralized authority, responsibility, and accountability, we come to our district meetings with the commitment to &ldquo;assist&rdquo; local leadership, not to take over.   We couldn&rsquo;t be nearly as effective without local leadership!
		  
			
		      </p>
			  <p><strong>MEMBERS ONLY ONLINE DOCUMENTS:</strong> As an active member, you will have access to numerous forms and association trademarked assets which aid members in running a rental property business.  Premium forms and products are available, providing &ldquo;best in class&rdquo; resources to run your business at an even higher level. (Much of this is in the development stage, as of Jan 1, 2013).
		  
			
		      </p>
			  <p><strong>EDUCATION and CERTIFICATIONS: </strong>We provide for our members the nationally recognized &ldquo;Professional Housing Provider (PHP) Certification (a NaREIA certification program of 60-hours) and our own &ldquo;IA-PHP&rdquo; certification (30-hours), custom designed for owners and managers of Iowa residential property.
		  
			
		      </p>
			  <p><strong>AFFILIATE MEMBERS</strong>:  Our Master Vendor Partners, Vendor Partners and Vendor Affiliates offer products and services of direct benefit for members.  We screen our vendor partners, to ensure that professional services and high quality products are being provided to our members, yielding a &ldquo;Speed of Trust&rdquo; dividend for those who do business with our Vendor Partners.

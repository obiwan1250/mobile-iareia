			<h2><center>Background Checks</center></h2>
			<div>
			  <p>One of the most important steps owners and property managers take prior to renting their property is to perform background checks.   Ask any veteran and they will say it is THE MOST CRITIAL STEP prior to executing a lease.</p>
			  <p>In fact, the only thing worse than a vacancy is a property has been let to a bad resident, especially one who fails to pay <strong><em>then maliciously destroys the place</em></strong> on the way out!</p>
			  <p>Our Association has for years provided four different levels of applicant background checks.</p>
			  <p>Our flagship product has been an &ldquo;Evictions Only&rdquo; check.   This entry level screening service included a check of our 180,000 name database, as well as public records for:</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li><em><strong>Petitions for Eviction</strong></em></li>
			    <li><strong><em>Evictions </em></strong></li>
			    <li><strong><em>Money Judgments, and </em></strong></li>
			    <li><strong><em>Damages, in Iowa only.</em></strong></li>
		      </ul>
			  <p><strong>The fee for this service has been nominal — $5.   This  fee is now $10, and will remain available until March 31, 2013 — though still a report with Iowa data only.<br>
			    </strong></p>
			  <p>The service, through CIC, has been enhanced to provide significantly more value for a nominal increase to $10.   There will be benefits to our members, including:</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li>More rapid response times, usually seconds to less than a minute.</li>
			    <li>Thorough checks — nationwide!</li>
			    <li>Having logged in and screened for evictions, if the applicant passes the first check, obtaining a complete credit report and/or a criminal check will be available in another few seconds, and at very reasonable cost ($15 or $22).</li>
			    <li>As always, our fees are subject to change with a 30-days notice.</li>
		      </ul>
			  <div><strong><em>The fees for these various products were announced October 1st.</em></strong></div>
			  <p>(NOTE: Obtaining Credit Reports requires setup.   For members, we will waive the setup fees until March 31.   After March 31, a fee of $50 may be charged for setup).</p>
			  <p>We expect to have a DVD video available for training purposes in the not too distant future.   Feel free to ask about status.</p>
